===============================================================

NEWS for version 0.2 (released on November 14, 2001)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features
============

o  Massive API changes.  This would not normally be called "a feature",
   but the old API was very wrong in a number of ways.  More API changes
   are to be expected for the next few releases.

o  All user-accessible library methods are now guarded by suitable
   sanity checks.  Exception are thrown whenever the library is not
   called in the intended way.

o  A SICStus Prolog interface is now available.  It comes with a somewhat
   interesting demo: a toy CLP(Q) interpreter.

Bugfixes
========

o  Many, many more than we would like to admit.
