===============================================================

NEWS for version 0.3 (released on February 24, 2002)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features
============

o  The library has been ported under libtool: it is now possible
   to build dynamic libraries as well.

o  We now use the integer C++ class of GMP to represent the
   coefficients of constraints and generators, instead of our own
   (very much inferior) Integer class.  The drawback is that we
   now require GMP 4.0.1 or higher.

o  New methods Polyhedron::convex_difference_assign(const Polyhedron&) and
   Polyhedron::convex_difference_assign_and_minimize(const Polyhedron&).
   They assigns to *this the convex hull of the set-theoretic difference
   of *this and the argument (possibly non minimized or minimized,
   respectively).

o  The method Polyhedron::add_generators(GenSys&) is now lazy,
   i.e., no minimization is performed.  Adding generators and
   minimizing at the same time is provided by the method
   Polyhedron::add_generators_and_minimize(GenSys&).

o  Some performance improvements.

o  Added more test programs.


Bugfixes
========

o  Fixed Polyhedron::satisfies(const Constraints&) and
   Polyhedron::affine_image().

o  Polyhedron::limited_widening_assign(const Polyhedron&, ConSys&)
   was erroneously returning a (random) boolean: it is now a void
   method.

NEWS for version 0.2 (released on November 14, 2001)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features
============

o  Massive API changes.  This would not normally be called "a feature",
   but the old API was very wrong in a number of ways.  More API changes
   are to be expected for the next few releases.

o  All user-accessible library methods are now guarded by suitable
   sanity checks.  Exception are thrown whenever the library is not
   called in the intended way.

o  A SICStus Prolog interface is now available.  It comes with a somewhat
   interesting demo: a toy CLP(Q) interpreter.

o  Greatly improved documentation.


Bugfixes
========

o  Many, many more than we would like to admit.
