The PPL developers encourage you to report any bugs you find to
ppl-devel@cs.unipr.it.  Here `bug' should be interpreted in its
broadest sense: outright software errors, misfeatures, bad interfaces,
missing or unclear documentation... whatever is a subject for possible
improvement.

As far as software bugs are concerned, the best reports are those that
are reproducible.  Including (or pointing us to) code
that exhibits the reported misbehavior is the best thing you can do to
help us fix the library.  Of course, this is not always possible and
we will welcome any kind of bug report.  Anyway, you may be interested
to read http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html on how
to report bugs effectively.
