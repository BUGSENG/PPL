This is the Parma Polyhedra Library, a C++ library for convex polyhedra.

To be more precise, the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) can handle all
the convex polyhedra that can be defined as the intersection of a
finite number of hyperspaces, each described by an equality or
inequality with rational coefficients.

The Parma Polyhedra Library is:

  + user friendly:
      you write `x + 2*y + 5*z <= 7' when you mean it;

  + fully dynamic:
      available virtual memory is the only limitation to the dimension
      of anything;

  + written in standard C++:
      meant to be portable;

  + exception-safe:
      never leaks resources or leaves invalid object fragments around;

  + rather efficient:
      and we hope to make it even more so;

  + thoroughly documented:
      perhaps not ``literate programming'' but close enough;

  + free software:
       distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
