Enhancements for PPL 0.7
========================

- The PowerSet class implementation is poorly documented.
  Consider also whether it should be called Powerset instead
  (notice the lower case `s' and that the same change should
  be done for Polyhedra_Powerset).
- We have an inconsistency: C_Polyhedron(const NNC_Polyhedron& y)
  throws an exception if `y' is not topologically closed, whereas
  the corresponding operation on Polyhedra_PowerSet computes
  topological closures.  This inconsistency should be removed.
- See for what reason why we have neither
  C_Polyhedron& C_Polyhedron::operator=(const NNC_Polyhedron& y)
  nor
  NNC_Polyhedron& NNC_Polyhedron::operator=(const C_Polyhedron& y).
- Consider whether it is the case to move the definition of dimension
  of a polyhedron in the user's manual and to refer to it in the
  documentation of Polyhedron::dimension().
- Make Polyhedron::dimension() available in all the interfaces.
- Allow the specification of alternative coefficient implementations.
- Clearly explain, in the documentation, how (not) to use
  set_GMP_memory_allocation_functions().  More generally, explain how
  to have memory-guarded computations.
- Completely rewrite the handling of temporary coefficients.
- Make sure ppl_lcdd is able to parse problems produced by lrs, i.e.,
  where the number of rows of the matrix is omitted and replaced by
  "*****".
- Add a README to the `tests' subdirectory.  There, explain how a
  test program in that directory can be turned into a program that
  can be used elsewhere.
- Better explain the tradeoff in the choice between C_ and NNC_Polyhedron.
- Investigate again all XFAILS.
- Explain the ordering of the arguments in the widening methods.
- Implement overflow detection when manipulating space dimensions.
- Consider renaming PowerSet::meet_assign().
- Implement Polyhedra_PowerSet::difference_assign(): it will compute
  a (non-redundant) set of polyhedra such that their union is the
  difference of the unions of the polyhedra contained in its arguments.
- Provide optimized implementations of Polyhedron::expand_dimension()
  Polyhedron::fold_dimensions().


Enhancements for PPL 0.8 or later versions
==========================================

- Implement void Polyhedron::envelope_assign(const Polyhedron& y).
- Implement the extrapolation operators defined in HenzingerH95
  and HenzingerPW01.
- See whether, using the techniques described in 
  ftp://ftp.ifor.math.ethz.ch/pub/fukuda/reports/polyunion001120.ps.gz
  we can implement bool poly_hull_assign_if_exact(PH& p, const PH& q),
  temporarily in algorithms.hh, more efficiently.


Constructions on Polyhedra
==========================

Since version 0.6, the PPL supports the determinate and powerset
constructions of the constraint system hierarchy described in

  R. Bagnara.
  A hierarchy of constraint systems for data-flow analysis
  of constraint logic-based languages.
  Science of Computer Programming 30, 1-2 (January 1998), pp. 119-155.
  Available at http://www.cs.unipr.it/~bagnara/Papers/Abstracts/SCP98

The implementation consists in a generic implementation (in the form
of C++ templates) of the hierarchy, plus a specialization of the
powerset construction on polyhedra.  What is missing now is the
ask-and-tell construction.  We have some old code implementing it
but it requires extensive work.


Efficiency Issues
=================

- There must be a more efficient way to implement
  bool Polyhedron::is_disjoint_from(const Polyhedron&).

- There must be a more efficient way to compute convex
  differences.

- We are being rather careless about the creation of temporaries
  as far as the classes LinExpression, Constraint and Generator
  are concerned.

- In Polyhedron::strongly_minimize_constraints(), after the removal
  of eps-redundant constraints, find an efficient way to test whether
  or not the eps_leq_one constraint is needed to obtain an upper bound
  on the epsilon dimension.


Cutting-Plane Methods
=====================

Suppose we are only interested in integral solutions (as is the
case, e.g., in most termination analyses).  Then cutting-plane methods
(Gomory, Chvátal, ...) allow to shrink polyhedra still not losing any
integral solution.

Z-Polyhedra
===========

We plan to extend the PPL to deal with Z-polyhedra [Ancourt91th].
Z-polyhedra are intersections and other representations for discrete sets.
