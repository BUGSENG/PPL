Design and Implementation of Strict Weak Orderings
--------------------------------------------------

Let S be a set and r be any binary relation over S.
The relation r=, called "r-equivalence" is defined as follows,
for each x and y in S:

    r=(x, y) iff  (not r(x, y)) and (not r(y, x)).

The relation r is a "strict weak ordering" (swo)
if and only if

1) r is irreflexive, i.e., r(x, x) is false for each x in S;
2) r is antisymmetric, i.e., r(x, y) implies not r(y, x);
3) r is transitive;
4) r= is also transitive.

Note that a "total" ordering is a strict weak ordering where
r-equivalence is equality.

In order to have associative containers of PPL polyhedra (such as sets
and maps of polyhedra) we need a strict weak ordering over them.
Actually it would be interesting, if at all possible, to define more
than one.  That is

- a fast to compute swo with no additional features;
- a total swo;
- a (total) swo that extends set inclusion, that is,
  x < y (x is strictly contained in y) implies r(x, y)
  for each polyhedra x and y.
