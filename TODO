Design and Implementation of Strict Weak Orderings
==================================================

Let S be a set and r be any binary relation over S.
The relation r=, called "r-equivalence" is defined as follows,
for each x and y in S:

    r=(x, y) iff  (not r(x, y)) and (not r(y, x)).

The relation r is a "strict weak ordering" (swo)
if and only if

1) r is irreflexive, i.e., r(x, x) is false for each x in S;
2) r is antisymmetric, i.e., r(x, y) implies not r(y, x);
3) r is transitive;
4) r= is also transitive.

Note that a "total" ordering is a strict weak ordering where
r-equivalence is equality.

In order to have associative containers of PPL polyhedra (such as sets
and maps of polyhedra) we need a strict weak ordering over them.
Actually it would be interesting, if at all possible, to define more
than one.  That is

- a fast to compute swo with no additional features;
- a total swo;
- a (total) swo that extends set-theoretic inclusion, that is,
  x < y (x is strictly contained in y) implies r(x, y)
  for each polyhedra x and y.


Constructions on Polyhedra
==========================

We want to extend the PPL so as to implement the constructions
of the constraint system hierarchy described in

  R. Bagnara.

  of constraint logic-based languages.

A generic implementation (in the form of C++ templates) of the entire
hierarchy has already been written.  What is missing is:

1) a wrapper class for PPL::Polyhedron so that a polyhedron is seen
   as a "determinate constraint system";
2) one or more strict weak ordering on polyhedra;
3) extending the above mentioned templates so as to work also with
   ordinary swos (the current implementation only supports total swos
   that extend entailment).  This should be done by extending the
   functionalities of the templates so that they can still exploit
   the features of more powerful swos.
