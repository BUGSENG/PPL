The SWI-Prolog interface to the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is
available both as a statically linked module or as a dynamically
linked one.  Only SWI-Prolog version 5.6.0 and later versions are
supported.


The `ppl_pl' Executable
-----------------------

The `ppl_pl' executable is simply the SWI-Prolog shell with the PPL
statically linked: from within `ppl_pl' all the services of the
library are available without further action.
Notice that, in case the PPL was configured with the
`--disable-static' option, in order to use `ppl_pl' you must make sure
your linker looks into the `<prefix>/lib/ppl' directory, where
<prefix> is the root of your installation (`/usr' or `/usr/local' in
most cases).


Loading the SWI-Prolog Interface Dynamically
--------------------------------------------

In order to dynamically load the library from SWI-Prolog you should
simply load `<prefix>/lib/ppl/ppl_swiprolog.pl'.
This will invoke `ppl_initialize/0' and `ppl_finalize/0'
automatically.  Alternatively, you can load the library directly with

    :- load_foreign_library('<prefix>/lib/ppl/libppl_swiprolog.so').

This will call `ppl_initialize/0' automatically.  Analogously,

    :- unload_foreign_library('<prefix>/lib/ppl/libppl_swiprolog.so').

will, as part of the unload process, invoke `ppl_finalize/0'.

Notice that, for dynamic linking to work, you should have configured
the library with the `--enable-shared' option (on most platforms this
is the default).
