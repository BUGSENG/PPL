/*! \mainpage Prolog Language Interface

The Parma Polyhedra Library comes equipped with a Prolog interface.
Despite the lack of standardization of Prolog's foreign language interfaces,
the PPL Prolog interface supports several Prolog systems and, to the
extent this is possible, provides a uniform view of the library from
each such system.

The structure of the Prolog interface manual is as follows:
- System-Independent Features
    - \ref prolog_interface_overview "Overview"
    - \ref predicate_specifications "Predicate Specifications"
    - \ref di_predicates "Domain Independent Predicates"
    - \ref mip_predicates "Predicates for MIP_Problem"
    - \ref pip_predicates "Predicates for PIP_Problem"
    - \ref configured_domains_predicates "Predicates for Configured Domains"
- \ref PI_Compilation "Compilation and Installation"
- \ref PI_SD_Features "System-Dependent Features"
    - \ref GNU_Prolog "GNU Prolog"
    - \ref CIAO_Prolog "CIAO Prolog"
    - \ref SICStus_Prolog "SICStus Prolog"
    - \ref SWI_Prolog "SWI Prolog"
    - \ref XSB_Prolog "XSB"
    - \ref YAP_Prolog "YAP"

In all the Prolog interface documentation pages,
<CODE>prefix</CODE> is the prefix under which
you have installed the library (typically <CODE>/usr</CODE>
or <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>).
