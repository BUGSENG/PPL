/*! \page PI_Compilation Compilation and Installation

When the Parma Polyhedra Library is configured, it tests for the existence
of each supported Prolog system.  If a supported Prolog system is
correctly installed in a standard location, things are arranged
so that the corresponding interface is built and installed.

The Prolog interface files are all installed in the directory
<CODE>prefix/lib/ppl</CODE>.  Since this includes shared and
dynamically loaded libraries, you must make your dynamic
linker/loader aware of this fact.  If you use a GNU/Linux system,
try the commands <CODE>man ld.so</CODE> and <CODE>man ldconfig</CODE>
for more information.

As an option, the Prolog interface can track the creation and disposal
of polyhedra.  In fact, differently from native Prolog data, PPL polyhedra
must be explicitly disposed and forgetting to do so is a very common mistake.
To enable this option, configure the library adding
<CODE>-DPROLOG_TRACK_ALLOCATION</CODE> to the options passed to the
C++ compiler.
Your configure command would then look like
\code
  path/to/configure --with-cxxflags="-DPROLOG_TRACK_ALLOCATION" ...
\endcode
