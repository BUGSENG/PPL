dnl
dnl For ease of keeping track of these macros and their dependencies,
dnl the macro definitions are separated by the "===" comments into groups.
dnl
dnl Where a macro is only used within the group, it is labelled as "LOCAL".
dnl Where it is used in this file but by another macro group, it is
dnl labelled as "PRIVATE" and an indication of which group uses it.
dnl Where it may be used in the generator files, it is labelled
dnl as "PUBLIC".
dnl
dnl Some simple macros may be redefined by generator files and we
dnl indicate that here is the default definition by the label
dnl "DEFAULT DEF".
