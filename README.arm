Configuration of the Parma Polyhedra Library on the ARM
=======================================================

On the ARM, whether or not the rounding mode can be set in a way that
allows the PPL to work with floating point numbers, will depend on the
actual hardware.  However, disabling the affected PPL code at run-time
is impractical.  Thus, to ensure that the binary distributions of the
PPL for the ARM work as expected on any hardware, on the ARM, the
affected code is disabled at compile-time.  It is still possible to
build a binary for the ARM that assumes the hardware can control the
rounding mode; for this, configure the PPL with
`-DPPL_ARM_CAN_CONTROL_FPU=1' included in CPPFLAGS.
For example:

  CPPFLAGS="-DPPL_ARM_CAN_CONTROL_FPU=1" .../configure ...
