//! A finite sparse sequence of coefficients.

  This class is implemented using a CO_Tree. See the documentation of CO_Tree
  for details on the implementation and the performance.

  This class is a drop-in replacement of Dense_Row, meaning that code
  using Dense_Row can be ported to Sparse_Row changing only the type.
  The resulting code will work, but probably needs more CPU and memory (it
  does not exploit the sparse representation yet).

  To take advantage of the sparse representation, the client code must then be
  modified to use methods which can have a faster implementation on sparse
  data structures.

  The main changes are the replacement of calls to operator[] with calls to
  find(), lower_bound() or insert(), using hint iterators when possible.
  Sequential scanning of rows should probably be implemented using iterators
  rather than indexes, to improve performance.
  reset() should be called to zero elements.
