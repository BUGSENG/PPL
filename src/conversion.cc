  \return
  The number of lines of the polyhedron or the number of equality
  constraints in the result of conversion.

  \param source
  The system to use to convert \p dest: it may be modified;

  \param start
  The index of \p source row from which conversion begin;

  \param dest
  The result of the conversion;

  \param sat
  The saturation matrix telling us, for each row in \p source, which
  are the rows of \p dest that satisfy but do not saturate it;

  \param num_lines_or_equalities
  The number of rows in the system \p dest that are either lines of
  the polyhedron (when \p dest is a system of generators) or equality
  constraints (when \p dest is a system of constraints).

  For simplicity, all the following comments assume we are converting a
  constraint system \p source to a generator system \p dest;
  the comments for the symmetric case can be obtained by duality.

  If some of the constraints in \p source are redundant, they will be removed.
  This is why the \p source is not declared to be a constant parameter.

  If \p start is 0, then \p source is a sorted system; also, \p dest is
  a generator system corresponding to an empty constraint system.
  If otherwise \p start is greater than 0, then the two sub-systems of
  \p source made by the non-pending rows and the pending rows, respectively,
  are both sorted; also, \p dest is the generator system corresponding to
  the non-pending constraints of \p source.

  Independently from the value of \p start, \p dest has lines from index 0
  to index \p num_lines_or_equalities - 1 and rays/points from index
  \p num_lines_or_equalities to the last of its rows.

  Note that here the rows of \p sat are indexed by rows of \p dest
  and its columns are indexed by rows of \p source.

  We know that polyhedra can be represented by both a system of
  constraints or a system of generators (points, rays and lines)
  (see Section \ref representation).
  When we have both descriptions for a polyhedron \f$P\f$
  we have what is called a <EM>double description</EM>
  (or <EM>DD pair</EM>) for \f$P\f$.

  Here, the <EM>representation system</EM> refers to the system \f$C\f$
  whose rows represent the constraints that characterize \f$P\f$
  and the <EM>generating system</EM>, the system \f$G\f$ whose rows
  represent the generators of \f$P\f$.
  We say that a pair \f$(C, G)\f$ of (real) systems is
  a <EM>double description pair</EM> if
  \f[
    C\vect{x} \geq \vect{0}
      \quad\iff\quad
        \exists \vect{\lambda} \geq \vect{0} \mathrel{.}
	\vect{x} = G\vect{\lambda}.
  \f]

  The term "double description" is quite natural in the sense that
  such a pair contains two different description of the same object.
  In fact, if we refer to the cone representation of a polyhedron \f$P\f$
  and we call \f$C\f$ and \f$G\f$ the systems of constraints and
  rays respectively, we have
  \f[
    P = \{\, \vect{x} \in \Rset^n \mid C\vect{x} \geq \vect{0}\, \}
      = \{\, \vect{x} \in \Rset^n \mid \vect{x} = G\vect{\lambda}
      \text{ for some } \vect{\lambda} \geq \vect{0}\, \}.
  \f]

  Because of the theorem of Minkowski (see Section \ref prelims),
  we can say that, given a \f$m \times n\f$ representation system
  \f$C\f$ such that
  \f$\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}(C) = n = \mathit{dimension of the whole space}\f$
  for a non-empty polyhedron \f$P\f$,
  it is always possible to find a generating system \f$G\f$ for \f$P\f$
  such that \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair.
  Conversely, Weyl's theorem ensures that, for each generating system
  \f$G\f$, it is possible to find a representation system \f$C\f$
  such that \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair.

  For efficiency reasons, our representation of polyhedra makes use
  of a double description.
  We are thus left with two problems:
    -# given \f$C\f$ find \f$G\f$ such that \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair;
    -# given \f$G\f$ find \f$C\f$ such that \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair.

  Using Farkas' Lemma we can prove that these two problems are
  computationally equivalent (i.e., linear-time reducible to each other).
  Farkas' Lemma establishes a fundamental property of vectors in
  \f$\Rset^n\f$ that, in a sense, captures the essence of duality.
  Consider a matrix \f$A \in \Rset^{m \times n}\f$ and let
  \f$\{ \vect{a}_1, \ldots, \vect{a}_m \}\f$ be its set of row vectors.
  Consider also another vector \f$\vect{c} \in \Rset^n\f$ such that,
  whenever a vector \f$\vect{y} \in \Rset^n\f$ has a non-negative projection
  on the \f$\vect{a}_i\f$'s, it also has a non-negative projection
  on \f$\vect{c}\f$.
  The lemma states that \f$\vect{c}\f$ has this property if and only if
  it is in the cone generated by the \f$\vect{a}_i\f$'s.
  Formally, the lemma states the equivalence of the two following
  assertions:
    -# \f$
         \forall \vect{y}
           \mathrel{:} (A\vect{y} \geq 0 \implies
	   \langle \vect{y},\vect{c} \rangle \geq 0)
       \f$;
    -# \f$
         \exists \vect{\lambda} \geq \vect{0}
           \mathrel{.} \vect{c}^\mathrm{T} = \vect{\lambda}^\mathrm{T}A
       \f$.

  With this result we can prove that \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair
  if and only if \f$(G^\mathrm{T}, C^\mathrm{T})\f$ is a DD pair.

  Suppose \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair.
  Thus, for each \f$x\f$ of the appropriate dimension,
  \f$C\vect{x} \geq \vect{0}\f$ if and only if
  \f$\exists \lambda \geq 0 \mathrel{.} \vect{x} = G\vect{\lambda}\f$,
  which is of course equivalent to
  \f$
    \exists \vect{\lambda} \geq \vect{0}
      \mathrel{.} \vect{x}^\mathrm{T} = \vect{\lambda}^\mathrm{T}G^\mathrm{T}
  \f$.

  First, we assume that \f$\vect{z}\f$ is such that
  \f$G^\mathrm{T}\vect{z} \geq \vect{0}\f$
  and we will show that
  \f$\exists \vect{\mu} \geq \vect{0} \mathrel{.}
  \vect{z} = C^\mathrm{T}\vect{\mu}\f$.
  Let \f$\vect{x}\f$ be such that \f$C\vect{x} \geq \vect{0}\f$.
  Since \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair, this is equivalent to
  \f$
    \exists \vect{\lambda} \geq \vect{0}
      \mathrel{.} \vect{x}^\mathrm{T} = \vect{\lambda}^\mathrm{T}G^\mathrm{T}
  \f$,
  which, by Farkas' Lemma is equivalent to
  \f$
    \forall \vect{y} \mathrel{:} (G^\mathrm{T}\vect{y} \geq \vect{0} \implies
                                 \langle \vect{y}, \vect{x} \rangle \geq 0)
  \f$.
  Taking \f$\vect{y} = \vect{z}\f$ and recalling our assumption that
  \f$G^\mathrm{T}\vect{z} \geq \vect{0}\f$
  we can conclude that \f$\langle \vect{z}, \vect{x} \rangle \geq 0\f$,
  that is equivalent to \f$\langle \vect{x}, \vect{z} \rangle \geq 0\f$.
  We have thus established that
  \f$
    \forall \vect{x} \mathrel{:} (C\vect{x} \geq \vect{0} \implies
    \langle \vect{x}, \vect{z} \rangle \geq 0)
  \f$.
  By Farkas' Lemma, this is equivalent to
  \f$\exists \vect{\mu} \geq \vect{0} \mathrel{.}
  \vect{z}^\mathrm{T} = \vect{\mu}^\mathrm{T} C\f$,
  which is equivalent to what we wanted to prove, that is,
  \f$\exists \vect{\mu} \geq \vect{0} \mathrel{.}
  \vect{z} = C^\mathrm{T}\vect{\mu}\f$.

  In order to prove the reverse implication, the following observation
  turns out to be useful:
  when \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair, \f$CG \geq 0\f$.
  In fact,
  let \f$\vect{e}_j\f$ be the vector whose components are all \f$0\f$
  apart from the \f$j\f$-th one, which is \f$1\f$.
  Clearly \f$\vect{e}_j \geq \vect{0}\f$ and, taking
  \f$\vect{\lambda} = \vect{e}_j\f$ and
  \f$\vect{x} = G\vect{\lambda} = G \vect{e}_j\f$, we have
  \f$C\vect{x} = C(G \vect{e}_j) = (CG)\vect{e}_j \geq \vect{0}\f$,
  since \f$(C, G)\f$ is a DD pair.
  Thus, as \f$(CG)\vect{e}_j\f$ is the \f$j\f$-th column of \f$CG\f$
  and since the choice of \f$j\f$ was arbitrary, \f$CG \geq \vect{0}\f$.

  We now assume that \f$\vect{z}\f$ is such that
  \f$\exists \vect{\mu} \geq \vect{0} \mathrel{.}
  \vect{z} = C^\mathrm{T}\vect{\mu}\f$
  and we will prove that \f$G^\mathrm{T}\vect{z} \geq \vect{0}\f$.
  By Farkas' Lemma, the assumption
  \f$\exists \vect{\mu} \geq \vect{0} \mathrel{.}
  \vect{z}^\mathrm{T} = \vect{\mu}^\mathrm{T}C\f$,
  is equivalent to
  \f$\forall \vect{y} \mathrel{:} (C\vect{y} \geq \vect{0}
  \implies \langle \vect{y}, \vect{z} \rangle \geq 0)\f$.
  If we take \f$\vect{y} = G\vect{e}_j\f$ then \f$C\vect{y}
                 = CG\vect{e}_j \geq 0\f$,
  since \f$CG \geq \vect{0}\f$.
  So
  \f$
    \langle \vect{y}, \vect{z} \rangle
      = (\vect{e}_j^\mathrm{T}G^\mathrm{T}) \vect{z}
      = \vect{e}_j^\mathrm{T}(G^\mathrm{T} \vect{z})
      \geq 0
  \f$,
  that is, the \f$j\f$-th component of \f$G^\mathrm{T}\vect{z}\f$
  is non-negative. The arbitrary choice of \f$j\f$ allows us to conclude
  that \f$G^\mathrm{T}\vect{z} \geq \vect{0}\f$, as required.

  In view of this result, the following exposition assumes, for clarity,
  that the conversion being performed is from constraints to generators.
  Thus, even if the roles of \p source and \p dest can be interchanged,
  in the sequel we assume the \p source system will contain the constraints
  that represent the polyhedron and the \p dest system will contain
  the generator that generates it.

  There are some observations that are useful to understand this function:

  Observation 1: Let \f$A\f$ be a system of constraints that generate
  the polyhedron \f$P\f$ and \f$\vect{c}\f$ a new constraint that must
  be added. Suppose that there is a line \f$\vect{z}\f$ that does not
  saturate the constraint \f$\vect{c}\f$. If we combine the old lines
  and rays that do not saturate \f$\vect{c}\f$ (except \f$\vect{z}\f$)
  with \f$\vect{z}\f$ such that the new ones saturate \f$\vect{c}\f$,
  the new lines and rays also saturate the constraints  saturated by
  the old lines and rays.

  In fact, if \f$\vect{y}_1\f$ is the old generator that does not saturate
  \f$\vect{c}\f$, \f$\vect{y}_2\f$ is the new one such that
  \f[
    \vect{y}_2 = \lambda \vect{y}_1 + \mu \vect{z}
  \f]
  and \f$\vect{c}_1\f$ is a previous constraint that \f$\vect{y}_1\f$
  and \f$\vect{z}\f$ saturates, we can see
  \f[
    \langle \vect{c}_1, \vect{y}_2 \rangle
    = \langle \vect{c}_1, (\lambda \vect{y}_1 + \mu \vect{z}) \rangle
    = \lambda \langle \vect{c}_1, \vect{y}_1 \rangle
       + \mu \langle \vect{c}_1, \vect{z} \rangle
       = 0 + \mu \langle \vect{c}_1, \vect{z} \rangle
       = \mu \langle \vect{c}_1, \vect{z} \rangle
  \f]
  and
  \f[
    \mu \langle \vect{c}_1, \vect{z} \rangle = 0.
  \f]

  Proposition 1: Let \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ be distinct
  rays of \f$P\f$.
  Then the following statements are equivalent:
  a) \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ are adjacent extreme rays
     (see Section \ref prelims);
  b) \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ are extreme rays and the
     rank of the system composed by the constraints saturated by both
     \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ is equal to
     \f$d - 2\f$, where \f$d\f$ is the rank of the system of constraints.

  In fact, let \f$F\f$ be the system of generators that saturate the
  constraints saturated by both \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$.
  If b) holds, the set \f$F\f$ is 2-dimensional and \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and
  \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ generate this set. So, every generator
  \f$\vect{x}\f$ of \f$F\f$ can be built as a combination of
  \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$, i.e.
  \f[
    \vect{x} = \lambda \vect{r}_1 + \mu \vect{r}_2.
  \f]
  This combination is non-negative because there exists at least a
  constraint \f$c\f$ saturated by \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and not
  \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ (or vice versa) (because they are distinct) for which
  \f[
    \langle \vect{c}, \vect{x} \rangle \geq 0
  \f]
  and
  \f[
    \langle \vect{c}, \vect{x} \rangle
    = \lambda \langle \vect{c}, \vect{r}_1 \rangle
                           (or = \mu \langle \vect{c}, \vect{r}_2 \rangle).
  \f]
  So, there is no other extreme ray in \f$F\f$ and a) holds.
  Otherwise, if b) does not hold, the rank of the system generated by
  the constraints saturated by both \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$
  is equal to \f$d - k\f$, with \p k \>= 3, the set \f$F\f$ is
  \p k -dimensional and at least \p k extreme rays are necessary
  to generate \f$F\f$.
  So, \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ are not adjacent and
  a) does not hold.

  Proposition 2: When we build the new system of generators starting from
  a system \f$A\f$ of constraints of \f$P\f$, if \f$\vect{c}\f$ is the
  constraint to add to \f$A\f$ and all lines of \f$P\f$ saturate
  \f$\vect{c}\f$, the new set of rays is the union of those rays that
  saturate, of those that satisfy and of a set \f$\overline Q\f$ of
  rays such that each of them
  -# lies on the hyper-plane represented by the k-th constraint,
  -# is a positive combination of two adjacent rays \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and
     \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ such that the first one satisfies the constraint and
     the other does not satisfy it.
  If the adjacency property is not taken in account, the new set of
  rays is not irredundant, in general.

  In fact, if \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ are not adjacent,
  the rank of the system composed by the constraints saturated by both
  \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ is different from \f$d - 2\f$
  (see the previous proposition) or neither \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ nor
  \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ are extreme rays. Since the new ray \f$\vect{r}\f$
  is a combination of \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and \f$\vect{r}_2\f$,
  it saturates the same constraints saturated by both \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ and
  \f$\vect{r}_2\f$.
  If the rank is less than \f$d - 2\f$, the rank of
  the system composed by \f$\vect{c}\f$ (that is saturated by \f$\vect{r}\f$)
  and by the constraints of \f$A\f$ saturated by \f$\vect{r}\f$  is less
  than \f$d - 1\f$. It means that \f$r\f$ is redundant (see
  Section \ref prelims).
  If neither \f$\vect{r}_1\f$ nor \f$\vect{r}_2\f$ are extreme rays,
  they belong to a 2-dimensional face containing exactly two extreme rays
  of \f$P\f$.
  These two adjacent rays build a ray equal to \f$\vect{r}\f$ and so
  \f$\vect{r}\f$ is redundant.
