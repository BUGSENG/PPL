  \param source
  The given system, which is not empty;

  \param dest
  The system to build and minimize;

  \param sat
  The saturation matrix.

  \p dest is not <CODE>const</CODE> because it will be built (and then
  modified) during minimize(). Also, \p sat and \p source are
  not <CODE>const</CODE> because the former will be built during
  \p dest creation and the latter will maybe be sorted and modified by
  <CODE>conversion()</CODE> and <CODE>simplify()</CODE>.

  \p sat has the generators on its columns and the constraints on its rows
  if \p con_to_gen is <CODE>true</CODE>, otherwise it has the generators on
  its rows and the constraints on its columns.

  Given \p source, this function builds (by means of
  <CODE>conversion()</CODE>) \p dest and then simplifies (invoking
  <CODE>simplify()</CODE>) \p source, erasing redundant rows.
  For the sequel we assume that \p source is the system of constraints
  and \p dest is the system of generators.
  This will simplify the description of the function; the dual case is
  similar.

  \param sat
  The saturation matrix that bind \p source1 to \p dest;

  The new system of generators or constraints.

  It is assumed that \p source1 and \p source2 are sorted and have
  no pending rows. It is also assumed that \p dest has no pending rows.
  On entry, the rows of \p sat are indexed by the rows of \p dest
  and its columns are indexed by the rows of \p source1.
  On exit, the rows of \p sat are indexed by the rows of \p dest
  and its columns are indexed by the rows of the system obtained
  by merging \p source1 and \p source2.

  Let us suppose we want to add some constraints to a given system of
  constraints \p source1. This method, given a minimized double description
  pair (\p source1, \p dest) and a system of new constraints \p source2,
  modifies \p source1 by adding to it the constraints of \p source2 that
  are not in \p source1. Then, by invoking
  <CODE>add_and_minimize(bool, Linear_System&, Linear_System&, Bit_Matrix&)</CODE>,
  processes the added constraints obtaining a new DD pair.

  This method treats also the dual case, i.e., adding new generators to
  a previous system of generators. In this case \p source1 contains the
  old generators, \p source2 the new ones and \p dest is the system
  of constraints in the given minimized DD pair.

  Since \p source2 contains the constraints (or the generators) that
  will be added to \p source1, it is constant: it will not be modified.
