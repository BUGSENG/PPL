/*! \ingroup PPL_CXX_interface
  An object of the class Grid represents a rational grid.

  The domain of grids <EM>optimally supports</EM>:
    - all (proper and non-proper) congruences;
    - tautological and inconsistent constraints;
    - linear equality constraints (i.e., non-proper congruences).

  Depending on the method, using a constraint that is not optimally
  supported by the domain will either raise an exception or
  result in a (possibly non-optimal) upward approximation.

  The domain of grids support a concept of double description similar
  to the one developed for polyhedra: hence, a grid can be specified
  as either a finite system of congruences or a finite system of
  generators (see Section \ref sect_rational_grids) and it is always
  possible to obtain either representation.
  That is, if we know the system of congruences, we can obtain
  from this a system of generators that define the same grid
  and vice versa.
  These systems can contain redundant members, or they can be in the
  minimal form.

  A key attribute of any grid is its space dimension (the dimension
  \f$n \in \Nset\f$ of the enclosing vector space):

  - all grids, the empty ones included, are endowed with a space
    dimension;
  - most operations working on a grid and another object (another
    grid, a congruence, a generator, a set of variables, etc.) will
    throw an exception if the grid and the object are not
    dimension-compatible (see Section \ref Grid_Space_Dimensions);
  - the only ways in which the space dimension of a grid can be
    changed are with <EM>explicit</EM> calls to operators provided for
    that purpose, and with standard copy, assignment and swap
    operators.

  Note that two different grids can be defined on the zero-dimension
  space: the empty grid and the universe grid \f$R^0\f$.

  \par
  In all the examples it is assumed that variables
  <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> are defined (where they are
  used) as follows:
  \code
  Variable x(0);
  Variable y(1);
  \endcode

  \par Example 1
  The following code builds a grid corresponding to the even integer
  pairs in \f$\Rset^2\f$, given as a system of congruences:
  \code
  Congruence_System cgs;
  cgs.insert((x %= 0) / 2);
  cgs.insert((y %= 0) / 2);
  Grid gr(cgs);
  \endcode
  The following code builds the same grid as above, but starting
  from a system of generators specifying three of the points:
  \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(grid_point(0*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(grid_point(0*x + 2*y));
  gs.insert(grid_point(2*x + 0*y));
  Grid gr(gs);
  \endcode

  \par Example 2
  The following code builds a grid corresponding to a line in
  \f$\Rset^2\f$ by adding a single congruence to the universe grid:
  \code
  Congruence_System cgs;
  cgs.insert(x - y == 0);
  Grid gr(cgs);
  \endcode
  The following code builds the same grid as above, but starting
  from a system of generators specifying a point and a line:
  \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(grid_point(0*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(grid_line(x + y));
  Grid gr(gs);
  \endcode

  \par Example 3
  The following code builds a grid corresponding to the integral
  points on the line \f$x = y\f$ in \f$\Rset^2\f$ constructed
  by adding an equality and congruence to the universe grid:
  \code
  Congruence_System cgs;
  cgs.insert(x - y == 0);
  cgs.insert(x %= 0);
  Grid gr(cgs);
  \endcode
  The following code builds the same grid as above, but starting
  from a system of generators specifying a point and a parameter:
  \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(grid_point(0*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(parameter(x + y));
  Grid gr(gs);
  \endcode

  \par Example 4
  The following code builds the grid corresponding to a plane by
  creating the universe grid in \f$\Rset^2\f$:
  \code
  Grid gr(2);
  \endcode
  The following code builds the same grid as above, but starting
  from the empty grid in \f$\Rset^2\f$ and inserting the appropriate
  generators (a point, and two lines).
  \code
  Grid gr(2, EMPTY);
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_point(0*x + 0*y));
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_line(x));
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_line(y));
  \endcode
  Note that a generator system must contain a point when describing
  a grid.  To ensure that this is always the case it is required
  that the first generator inserted in an empty grid is a point
  (otherwise, an exception is thrown).

  \par Example 5
  The following code shows the use of the function
  <CODE>add_space_dimensions_and_embed</CODE>:
  \code
  Grid gr(1);
  gr.add_congruence(x == 2);
  gr.add_space_dimensions_and_embed(1);
  \endcode
  We build the universe grid in the 1-dimension space \f$\Rset\f$.
  Then we add a single equality congruence,
  thus obtaining the grid corresponding to the singleton set
  \f$\{ 2 \} \sseq \Rset\f$.
  After the last line of code, the resulting grid is
  \f[
  \bigl\{\,
  (2, y)^\transpose \in \Rset^2
  \bigm|
  y \in \Rset
  \,\bigr\}.
  \f]

  \par Example 6
  The following code shows the use of the function
  <CODE>add_space_dimensions_and_project</CODE>:
  \code
  Grid gr(1);
  gr.add_congruence(x == 2);
  gr.add_space_dimensions_and_project(1);
  \endcode
  The first two lines of code are the same as in Example 4 for
  <CODE>add_space_dimensions_and_embed</CODE>.
  After the last line of code, the resulting grid is
  the singleton set
  \f$\bigl\{ (2, 0)^\transpose \bigr\} \sseq \Rset^2\f$.

  \par Example 7
  The following code shows the use of the function
  <CODE>affine_image</CODE>:
  \code
  Grid gr(2, EMPTY);
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_point(0*x + 0*y));
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_point(4*x + 0*y));
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_point(0*x + 2*y));
  Linear_Expression expr = x + 3;
  gr.affine_image(x, expr);
  \endcode
  In this example the starting grid is all the pairs of \f$x\f$ and
  \f$y\f$ in \f$\Rset^2\f$ where \f$x\f$ is an integer multiple of 4
  and \f$y\f$ is an integer multiple of 2.  The considered variable
  is \f$x\f$ and the affine expression is \f$x+3\f$.  The resulting
  grid is the given grid translated 3 integers to the right (all the
  pairs \f$(x, y)\f$ where \f$x\f$ is -1 plus an integer multiple of 4
  and \f$y\f$ is an integer multiple of 2).
  Moreover, if the affine transformation for the same variable \p x
  is instead \f$x+y\f$:
  \code
  Linear_Expression expr = x + y;
  \endcode
  the resulting grid is every second integral point along the \f$x=y\f$
  line, with this line of points repeated at every fourth integral value
  along the \f$x\f$ axis.
  Instead, if we do not use an invertible transformation for the
  same variable; for example, the affine expression \f$y\f$:
  \code
  Linear_Expression expr = y;
  \endcode
  the resulting grid is every second point along the \f$x=y\f$ line.

  \par Example 8
  The following code shows the use of the function
  <CODE>affine_preimage</CODE>:
  \code
  Grid gr(2, EMPTY);
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_point(0*x + 0*y));
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_point(4*x + 0*y));
  gr.add_grid_generator(grid_point(0*x + 2*y));
  Linear_Expression expr = x + 3;
  gr.affine_preimage(x, expr);
  \endcode
  In this example the starting grid, \p var and the affine
  expression and the denominator are the same as in Example 6, while
  the resulting grid is similar but translated 3 integers to the
  left (all the pairs \f$(x, y)\f$
  where \f$x\f$ is -3 plus an integer multiple of 4 and
  \f$y\f$ is an integer multiple of 2)..
  Moreover, if the affine transformation for \p x is \f$x+y\f$
  \code
  Linear_Expression expr = x + y;
  \endcode
  the resulting grid is a similar grid to the result in Example 6,
  only the grid is slanted along \f$x=-y\f$.
  Instead, if we do not use an invertible transformation for the same
  variable \p x, for example, the affine expression \f$y\f$:
  \code
  Linear_Expression expr = y;
  \endcode
  the resulting grid is every fourth line parallel to the \f$x\f$
  axis.

  \par Example 9
  For this example we also use the variables:
  \code
  Variable z(2);
  Variable w(3);
  \endcode
  The following code shows the use of the function
  <CODE>remove_space_dimensions</CODE>:
  \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(grid_point(3*x + y +0*z + 2*w));
  Grid gr(gs);
  Variables_Set to_be_removed;
  to_be_removed.insert(y);
  to_be_removed.insert(z);
  gr.remove_space_dimensions(to_be_removed);
  \endcode
  The starting grid is the singleton set
  \f$\bigl\{ (3, 1, 0, 2)^\transpose \bigr\} \sseq \Rset^4\f$, while
  the resulting grid is
  \f$\bigl\{ (3, 2)^\transpose \bigr\} \sseq \Rset^2\f$.
  Be careful when removing space dimensions <EM>incrementally</EM>:
  since dimensions are automatically renamed after each application
  of the <CODE>remove_space_dimensions</CODE> operator, unexpected
  results can be obtained.
  For instance, by using the following code we would obtain
  a different result:
  \code
  set<Variable> to_be_removed1;
  to_be_removed1.insert(y);
  gr.remove_space_dimensions(to_be_removed1);
  set<Variable> to_be_removed2;
  to_be_removed2.insert(z);
  gr.remove_space_dimensions(to_be_removed2);
  \endcode
  In this case, the result is the grid
  \f$\bigl\{(3, 0)^\transpose \bigr\} \sseq \Rset^2\f$:
  when removing the set of dimensions \p to_be_removed2
  we are actually removing variable \f$w\f$ of the original grid.
  For the same reason, the operator \p remove_space_dimensions
  is not idempotent: removing twice the same non-empty set of dimensions
  is never the same as removing them just once.

    When considering the generators of a grid, the

    \f[
      \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i x_i + b}{\mathrm{denominator}}
    \f]

    If congruences are up-to-date, it uses the specialized function
    affine_preimage() (for the system of congruences)
    and inverse transformation to reach the same result.
    To obtain the inverse transformation we use the following observation.

    -# The affine transformation is invertible if the coefficient
       of \p var in this transformation (i.e., \f$a_\mathrm{var}\f$)
