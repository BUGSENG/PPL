//! A not necessarily closed convex polyhedron.
/*! \ingroup PPL_CXX_interface
    An object of the class NNC_Polyhedron represents a
    <EM>not necessarily closed</EM> (NNC) convex polyhedron
    in the vector space \f$\Rset^n\f$.

    \note
    Since NNC polyhedra are a generalization of closed polyhedra,
    any object of the class C_Polyhedron can be (explicitly) converted
    into an object of the class NNC_Polyhedron.
    The reason for defining two different classes is that objects of
    the class C_Polyhedron are characterized by a more efficient
    implementation, requiring less time and memory resources.
