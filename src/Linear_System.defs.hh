//! The base class for systems of constraints and generators.
/*! \ingroup PPL_CXX_interface
  An object of this class represents either a constraint system
  or a generator system. Each Linear_System object can be viewed
  as a finite sequence of strong-normalized Row objects,
  where each Row implements a constraint or a generator.
  Linear systems are characterized by the matrix of coefficients,
  also encoding the number, size and capacity of Row objects,
  as well as a few additional information, including:
   - the topological kind of (all) the rows;
   - an indication of whether or not some of the rows in the Linear_System
     are <EM>pending</EM>, meaning that they still have to undergo
     an (unspecified) elaboration; if there are pending rows, then these
     form a proper suffix of the overall sequence of rows;
   - a Boolean flag that, when <CODE>true</CODE>, ensures that the
     non-pending prefix of the sequence of rows is sorted.
