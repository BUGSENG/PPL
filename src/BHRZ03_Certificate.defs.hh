//! The convergence certificate for the BHRZ03 widening operator.
/*! \ingroup PPL_CXX_interface
  Convergence certificates are used to instantiate the BHZ03 framework
  so as to define widening operators for the finite powerset domain.

  \note
  Each convergence certificate has to be used together with a
  compatible widening operator. In particular, BHRZ03_Certificate
  can certify the convergence of both the BHRZ03 and the H79 widenings.
