//! A conjunctive assertion about a polyhedron.
/*! \ingroup PPL_CXX_interface
  The assertions supported are:
  - <EM>zero-dim universe</EM>: the polyhedron is the zero-dimension
    vector space \f$\Rset^0 = \{\cdot\}\f$;
  - <EM>empty</EM>: the polyhedron is the empty set;
  - <EM>constraints pending</EM>: the polyhedron is correctly
    characterized by the attached system of constraints, which is
    split in two non-empty subsets: the already processed constraints,
    which are in minimal form, and the pending constraints, which
    still have to be processed and may thus be inconsistent or
    contain redundancies;
  - <EM>generators pending</EM>: the polyhedron is correctly
    characterized by the attached system of generators, which is
    split in two non-empty subsets: the already processed generators,
    which are in minimal form, and the pending generators, which still
    have to be processed and may thus contain redundancies;
  - <EM>constraints up-to-date</EM>: the polyhedron is correctly
    characterized by the attached system of constraints, modulo the
    processing of pending generators;
  - <EM>generators up-to-date</EM>: the polyhedron is correctly
    characterized by the attached system of generators, modulo the
    processing of pending constraints;
  - <EM>constraints minimized</EM>: the non-pending part of the system
    of constraints attached to the polyhedron is in minimal form;
  - <EM>generators minimized</EM>: the non-pending part of the system
    of generators attached to the polyhedron is in minimal form;
  - <EM>constraints' saturation matrix up-to-date</EM>: the attached
    saturation matrix having rows indexed by non-pending generators and
    columns indexed by non-pending constraints correctly expresses
    the saturation relation between the attached non-pending constraints
    and generators;
  - <EM>generators' saturation matrix up-to-date</EM>: the attached
    saturation matrix having rows indexed by non-pending constraints and
    columns indexed by non-pending generators correctly expresses
    the saturation relation between the attached non-pending constraints
    and generators;

  Not all the conjunctions of these elementary assertions constitute
  a legal Status.  In fact:
  - <EM>zero-dim universe</EM> excludes any other assertion;
  - <EM>empty</EM>: excludes any other assertion;
  - <EM>constraints pending</EM> and <EM>generators pending</EM>
    are mutually exclusive;
  - <EM>constraints pending</EM> implies both <EM>constraints minimized</EM>
    and <EM>generators minimized</EM>;
  - <EM>generators pending</EM> implies both <EM>constraints minimized</EM>
    and <EM>generators minimized</EM>;
  - <EM>constraints minimized</EM> implies <EM>constraints up-to-date</EM>;
  - <EM>generators minimized</EM> implies <EM>generators up-to-date</EM>;
  - <EM>constraints' saturation matrix up-to-date</EM> implies both
    <EM>constraints up-to-date</EM> and <EM>generators up-to-date</EM>;
  - <EM>generators' saturation matrix up-to-date</EM> implies both
    <EM>constraints up-to-date</EM> and <EM>generators up-to-date</EM>.
