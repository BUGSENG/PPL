//! A sparse matrix of Coefficient.
/*!
  This class is a drop-in replacement of Dense_Matrix, meaning that code
  using Dense_Matrix can be ported to Sparse_Matrix changing only references
  to Dense_Matrix and Dense_Row into references to Sparse_Matrix and
  Sparse_Row. The resulting code will work, but probably needs more CPU and
  memory (it does not exploit the sparse representation yet).
  To avoid unnecessary preprocessor's if conditions, use the row_type type
  defined in both Dense_Matrix and Sparse_Matrix instead of using Dense_Row
  and Sparse_Row directly.

  To take advantage of the sparse representation, the client code must then be
  modified to use methods which can have a faster implementation on sparse
  data structures.

  The main changes are the replacement of calls to operator[] on Sparse_Row
  objects with calls to find(), lower_bound() or insert(), using hint
  iterators when possible. Sequential scanning of rows should probably be
  implemented using iterators rather than indexes, to improve performance.
  reset() should be called to zero elements.
