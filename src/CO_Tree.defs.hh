namespace Parma_Polyhedra_Library {

//! A cache-oblivious binary search tree of pairs.
/*!
  This class implements a binary search tree with keys of dimension_type type
  and data of Coefficient type, laid out in a dynamically-sized array.

  The array-based layout saves calls to new/delete (to insert n elements
  only \f$O(\log n)\f$ allocations are performed) and, more importantly, is
  much more cache-friendly than a standard (pointer-based) tree, because the
  elements are stored sequentially in memory (leaving some holes to allow
  fast insertion of new elements).
  The downside of this representation is that all iterators are invalidated
  when an element is added or removed, because the array could have been
  enlarged or shrunk. This is partially addressed by providing references to
  internal end iterators that are updated when needed.

  B-trees are cache-friendly too, but the cache size is fixed (usually at
  compile-time). This raises two problems: firstly the cache size must be
  known in advance and those data structures do not perform well with other
  cache sizes and, secondly, even if the cache size is known, the
  optimizations target only one level of cache. This kind of data structures
  are called cache aware. This implementation, instead, is cache oblivious:
  it performs well with every cache size, and thus exploits all of the
  available caches.

  Assuming \p n is the number of elements in the tree and \p B is the number
  of (dimension_type, Coefficient) pairs that fit in a cache line, the
  time and cache misses complexities are the following:

  - Insertions/Queries/Deletions: \f$O(\log^2 n)\f$ time,
                                  \f$O(\log \frac{n}{B}))\f$ cache misses.
  - Tree traversal from begin() to end(), using an %iterator: \f$O(n)\f$ time,
         \f$O(\frac{n}{B})\f$  cache misses.
  - Queries with a hint: \f$O(\log k)\f$ time and \f$O(\log \frac{k}{B})\f$
    cache misses, where k is the distance between the given %iterator and the
    searched element (or the position where it would have been).

  The binary search tree is embedded in a (slightly bigger) complete tree,
  that is enlarged and shrunk when needed. The complete tree is laid out
  in an in-order DFS layout in two arrays: one for the keys and one for the
  associated data.
  The indexes and values are stored in different arrays to reduce
  cache-misses during key queries.

  The tree can store up to (-(dimension_type)1)/100 elements.
  This limit allows faster density computations, but can be removed if needed.
