//! A system of grid generators.
/*!
    An object of the class Grid_Generator_System is a system of generators,
    i.e., a multiset of objects of the class Generator
    (lines, rays, points and closure points).
    When inserting generators in a system, space dimensions are automatically
    adjusted so that all the generators in the system are defined
    on the same vector space.
    A system of generators which is meant to define a non-empty
    polyhedron must include at least one point: the reason is that
    lines, rays and closure points need a supporting point
    (lines and rays only specify directions while closure points only
    specify points in the topological closure of the NNC polyhedron).

    \par
     In all the examples it is assumed that variables
    <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> are defined as follows:
    \code
  Variable x(0);
  Variable y(1);
    \endcode

    \par Example 1
    The following code defines the line having the same direction
    as the \f$x\f$ axis (i.e., the first Cartesian axis)
    in \f$\Rset^2\f$:
    \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(line(x + 0*y));
    \endcode
    As said above, this system of generators corresponds to
    an empty polyhedron, because the line has no supporting point.
    To define a system of generators that does correspond to
    the \f$x\f$ axis, we can add the following code which
    inserts the origin of the space as a point:
    \code
  gs.insert(point(0*x + 0*y));
    \endcode
    Since space dimensions are automatically adjusted, the following
    code obtains the same effect:
    \code
  gs.insert(point(0*x));
    \endcode
    In contrast, if we had added the following code, we would have
    defined a line parallel to the \f$x\f$ axis through
    the point \f$(0, 1)^\transpose \in \Rset^2\f$.
    \code
  gs.insert(point(0*x + 1*y));
    \endcode

    \par Example 2
    The following code builds a ray having the same direction as
    the positive part of the \f$x\f$ axis in \f$\Rset^2\f$:
    \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(ray(x + 0*y));
    \endcode
    To define a system of generators indeed corresponding to the set
    \f[
      \bigl\{\,
        (x, 0)^\transpose \in \Rset^2
      \bigm|
        x \geq 0
      \,\bigr\},
    \f]
    one just has to add the origin:
    \code
  gs.insert(point(0*x + 0*y));
    \endcode

    \par Example 3
    The following code builds a system of generators having four points
    and corresponding to a square in \f$\Rset^2\f$
    (the same as Example 1 for the system of constraints):
    \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(point(0*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(point(0*x + 3*y));
  gs.insert(point(3*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(point(3*x + 3*y));
    \endcode

    \par Example 4
    By using closure points, we can define the \e kernel
    (i.e., the largest open set included in a given set)
    of the square defined in the previous example.
    Note that a supporting point is needed and, for that purpose,
    any inner point could be considered.
    \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(point(x + y));
  gs.insert(closure_point(0*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(closure_point(0*x + 3*y));
  gs.insert(closure_point(3*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(closure_point(3*x + 3*y));
    \endcode

    \par Example 5
    The following code builds a system of generators having two points
    and a ray, corresponding to a half-strip in \f$\Rset^2\f$
    (the same as Example 2 for the system of constraints):
    \code
  Grid_Generator_System gs;
  gs.insert(point(0*x + 0*y));
  gs.insert(point(0*x + 1*y));
  gs.insert(ray(x - y));
    \endcode

    \note
    After inserting a multiset of generators in a generator system,
    there are no guarantees that an <EM>exact</EM> copy of them
    can be retrieved:
    in general, only an <EM>equivalent</EM> generator system
    will be available, where original generators may have been
    reordered, removed (if they are duplicate or redundant), etc.

  copy(gs.begin(), gs.end(), ostream_iterator<Grid_Generator>(cout, "\n"));
