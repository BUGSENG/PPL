//! A conjunctive assertion about a BD_Shape<T> object.
/*! \ingroup PPL_CXX_interface
  The assertions supported are:
  - <EM>zero-dim universe</EM>: the BDS is the zero-dimensional
    vector space \f$\Rset^0 = \{\cdot\}\f$;
  - <EM>empty</EM>: the BDS is the empty set;
  - <EM>shortest-path closed</EM>: the BDS is represented by a shortest-path
    closed system of bounded differences, so that all the constraints are
    as tight as possible;
  - <EM>shortest-path reduced</EM>: the BDS is represented by a shortest-path
    closed system of bounded differences and each constraint in such a system
    is marked as being either redundant or non-redundant.

  Not all the conjunctions of these elementary assertions constitute
  a legal Status.  In fact:
  - <EM>zero-dim universe</EM> excludes any other assertion;
  - <EM>empty</EM>: excludes any other assertion;
  - <EM>shortest-path reduced</EM> implies <EM>shortest-path closed</EM>.
