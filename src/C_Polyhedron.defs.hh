//! A closed convex polyhedron.
/*! \ingroup PPL_CXX_interface
    An object of the class C_Polyhedron represents a
    <EM>topologically closed</EM> convex polyhedron
    in the vector space \f$\Rset^n\f$.

    When building a closed polyhedron starting from
    a system of constraints, an exception is thrown if the system
    contains a <EM>strict inequality</EM> constraint.
    Similarly, an exception is thrown when building a closed polyhedron
    starting from a system of generators containing a <EM>closure point</EM>.

    \note
    Such an exception will be obtained even if the system of
    constraints (resp., generators) actually defines
    a topologically closed subset of the vector space, i.e.,
    even if all the strict inequalities (resp., closure points)
    in the system happen to be redundant with respect to the
    system obtained by removing all the strict inequality constraints
    (resp., all the closure points).
    In contrast, when building a closed polyhedron starting from
    an object of the class NNC_Polyhedron,
    the precise topological closure test will be performed.
