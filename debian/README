Building the Debian packages
============================

The simplest way to build the Debian packages is to run the following
command in an up-to-date PPL directory.

	dpkg-buildpackage -rsudo

`dpkg-buildpackage' is available in the dpkg-dev package.  Here the
`sudo' program (from the sudo package) is also required.  This will
build the PPL using the standard GMP, C compiler and C++ compiler.
Note that the configuration of GMP, at least on the Debian stable
distribution, lacks the -fexceptions preprocessor flag, which is
required for PPL memory bounds handling.

Alternatively, the `pbuilder' program (from the pbuilder package) can
be used to build a "clean-room" package.  `pbuilder' sets up a chroot
of a minimal stable distribution and then builds the package inside
the chroot.  This is good to verify the build dependencies.  It also
may be required, to ensure that the PPL is built against the compiler
and GMP from the stable distributions (if, for example, the build
machine uses the testing or unstable distributions).  The command is
