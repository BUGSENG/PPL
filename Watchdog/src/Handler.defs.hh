/*!
  The template class Handler_Flag<Flag_Base, Flag> is an handler whose
  job is to install a flag onto an <EM>holder</EM> for the flag.
  The flag is of type \p Flag and the holder is a (volatile) pointer
  to \p Flag_Base.  Installing the flag onto the holder means making
  the holder point to the flag, so that it must be possible to assign
  a value of type <CODE>Flag*</CODE> to an entity of type
  <CODE>Flag_Base*</CODE>.
  The class \p Flag must provide the method

  \code
    int priority() const
  \endcode
  returning an integer priority associated to the flag.

  The handler will install its flag onto the holder only if the holder
  is empty, namely, it is the null pointer, or if the holder holds a
  flag of strictly lower priority.
