Most of the examples in this directory have been taken (sometimes with
changes) from cddlib version 0.93c [1] and lrslib version 4.2 [2].
The changes consisted in the removal of commands that are not
implemented in `ppl_lcdd', the revision of some comments and, for some
examples, in the conversion of floating point coefficients to integer
or rational numbers.  In this last case, the name of the example has
been changed from, e.g., `file.ine' to `file_m.ine'.
