  Abstract = "We aim at the the development of precise, practical, and
             theoretically well-founded data-flow analyzers for
             constraint logic-based languages. The design and
             development of such an analyzer fostered a number of
             research problems that we had to address. A hierarchy of
             constraint systems is introduced that is suitable for
             designing and combining abstract domains. The rational
             construction of a generic domain for the structural
             analysis of CLP programs is presented. We also address
             the problem of the ``missing \emph{occur-check}'' in many
             implemented languages.  We introduce a new family of
             domains, based on constraint propagation techniques, for
             the abstraction of the numerical leaves that occur in the
             terms of CLP languages. Despite the fact that groundness
             analysis for logic-based languages is a widely studied
             subject, a novel domain for groundness analysis is
             presented that outperforms the existing domains from
             several points of view. Finally, we present a bottom-up
             analysis technique for CLP languages that allows for the
             precise derivation of both call- and success-patterns
             preserving the connection between them."

  Abstract = "Many interesting analyses for constraint logic-based
              languages are aimed at the detection of \emph{monotonic}
              properties, that is to say, properties that are
              preserved as the computation progresses.  Our basic
              claim is that most, if not all, of these analyses can be
              described within a unified notion of constraint domains.
              We present a class of constraint systems that allows for
              a smooth integration within an appropriate framework for
              the definition of non-standard semantics of constraint
              logic-based languages.  Such a framework is also
              presented and motivated.  We then show how such domains
              can be built, as well as construction techniques that
              induce a hierarchy of domains with interesting
              properties.  In particular, we propose a general
              methodology for domain combination with asynchronous
              interaction (i.e., the interaction is not necessarily
              synchronized with the domains' operations).  By
              following this methodology, interesting combinations of
              domains can be expressed with all the the semantic
              elegance of concurrent constraint programming
              languages.",

  Abstract = "Convex polyhedra, commonly employed for the analysis and
              verification of both hardware and software, may be
              defined either by a finite set of linear inequality
              constraints or by finite sets of generating points and
              rays of the polyhedron.  Although most implementations
              of the polyhedral operations assume that the polyhedra
              are topologically closed (i.e., all the constraints
              defining them are non-strict), several analyzers and
              verifiers need to compute on a domain of convex
              polyhedra that are not necessarily closed (NNC).  The
              usual approach to implementing NNC polyhedra is to embed
              them into closed polyhedra in a vector space having one
              extra dimension and reuse the tools and techniques
              already available for closed polyhedra.  Previously,
              this embedding has been designed so that a constant
              number of constraints and a linear number of generators
              have to be added to the original NNC specification of
              the polyhedron.  In this paper we explore an alternative
              approach: while still using an extra dimension to
              represent the NNC polyhedron by a closed polyhedron, the
              new embedding adds a linear number of constraints and a
              constant number of generators.  We discuss the relative
              benefits of these two implementations and how the choice
              of representation can affect the efficiency of the
              polyhedral operations.  As far as the issue of providing
              a non-redundant description of the NNC polyhedron is
              concerned, we generalize the results established in a
              previous paper so that they apply to both encodings."

              model checker for mixed discrete-continuous systems that
              are modeled as automata with piecewise-constant
              polyhedral differential inclusions. The use of a formal
              input language and automated procedures for state-space
              traversal lay the foundation for formally verifying
              properties of hybrid dynamical systems. We describe some
              recent experiences analyzing three hybrid systems. We
              point out the successes and limitations of the tool. The
              analysis procedure has been extended in a number of ways
              to address some of the tool's shortcomings. We evaluate
              these extensions, and conclude with some desiderata for
              verification tools for hybrid systems.",

              problems. For this reason, there is a need for representing and
              symbolically analyzing linearly parameterized algorithms.
              An important class of parallel algorithms can be described as
              systems of parameterized affine recurrence equations (PARE).
              In this representation, linearly parameterized polyhedra are
              used to described the domains of variables. This paper describes
              an algorithm which computes the set of parameterized vertices of
              a polyhedron, given its representation as a system of
              parameterized inequalities. This provides an important tool for

              consists in statically and automatically discovering
              properties verified at execution time. Different sets of
              properties (equality, inequality and congruence
              relations) have already been studied. This thesis
              proposes a generalization of some of the below
              patterns. More specifically, the abstract interpretation
              is used to design on the one hand a set of properties
              generalizing intervals and cosets on $\mathbbb{Z}$ and
              on the other hand, a generalization of trapezoids and
              linear congruence equation systems on $\mathbbb{Z}^n$.
              A rational abstraction of these properties is defined to
              get safe approximations, with a polynomial complexity in
              the number of the considered variables, of the integer
              properties operators. Those analyses, more precise than
              the combination of the analysis they come from in
              general, allow to dynamically choose the kind of
              properties (inequality or congruence relations) leading
              to relevant information for the considered program. The
              described relationnal analysis corresponds to numerous
              patterns encountered in the field of scientific
              computation.  It is very well adapted to the analysis of

  Abstract = "Bottom-up evaluation of a program-query pair in a
              constraint query language (CQL) starts with the facts in
              the database and repeatedly applies the rules of the
              program, in iterations, to compute new facts, until we
              have reached a fixpoint.  Checking if a fixpoint has
              been reached amounts to checking if any ``new'' facts
              were computed in an iteration.  Such a check also
              enhances efficiency in that subsumed facts can be
              discarded, and not be used to make any further
              derivations in subsequent iterations, if we use
              Semi-naive evaluation.

              We show that the problem of subsumption in CQLs with
              linear arithmetic constraints is co-NP complete, and
              present a deterministic algorithm, based on the divide
              and conquer strategy, for this problem.  We also
              identify polynomial-time sufficient conditions for
              subsumption and non-subsumption in CQLs with linear
              arithmetic constraints.  We adapt indexing strategies
              from spatial databases for efficiently indexing facts in
              such a CQL: such indexing is crucial for performance in
              the presence of large databases.  Based on a recent
              algorithm by Lassez and Lassez [LL] for quantifier
              elimination, we present an incremental version of the

                Polyhedra are also used in the definition of
