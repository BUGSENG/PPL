              problem: given a set of extremal rays and vertices, find the
              associated irredundant set of facet supporting hyperplanes.
              The method is an extension of initial Chernikova's

              polyhedral cone duality principle. A new enhancement for

  Abstract = "Polyhedra are geometric representations of linear
              systems of equations and inequalities.  Since
              polyhedra are used to represent the iteration
              domains of nested loop programs, procedures for
              operating on polyhedra are useful for doing loop
              transformations and other program restructuring
              transformations which are needed in parallelizing
              compilers.  Thus a need for a library of polyhedral
              operations has recently been recognized in the
              parallelizing compiler community.
                Polyhedra are also used in the definition of
              domains of variables in systems of affine recurrence
              equations (SARE). {\sc Alpha} is a language which is
              based on the SARE formalism in which all variables
              are declared over finite unions of polyhedra.  This
              report describes a library of polyhedral functions
              which was developed to support the {\sc Alpha}
              language environment, and which is general enough
              to satisfy the needs of researchers doing
              parallelizing compilers.
                This report describes the data structures used to
              represent domains, gives motivations for the major
              design decisions, and presents the algorithms used
              for doing polyhedral operations.
                This library has been written and tested, and has
              been in use since the beginning of 1993 by research
              facilities in Europe and Canada.  The library is
              freely distributed by ftp.",
