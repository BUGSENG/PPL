  Abstract = "A technique for generating invariant polynomial
              \emph{inequalities} of bounded degree is presented using
              the abstract interpretation framework.  It is based on
              overapproximating basic semi-algebraic sets, i.e., sets
              defined by conjunctions of polynomial inequalities, by
              means of convex polyhedra.  While improving on the
              existing methods for generating invariant polynomial
              \emph{equalities}, since polynomial inequalities are
              allowed in the guards of the transition system, the
              approach does not suffer from the prohibitive complexity
              of the methods based on quantifier-elimination.  The
              application of our implementation to benchmark programs
              shows that the method produces non-trivial invariants in
              reasonable time.  In some cases the generated invariants
              are essential to verify safety properties that cannot be
              proved with classical linear invariants."

              compositional reasoning that is conservative in the

              contrast to previous approaches that require global

              safety properties of hybrid systems with piecewise

              constraints and the dynamics of the system.  PHAVer's
              exact arithmetic is robust due to the use of the Parma
              Polyhedra Library, which supports arbitrarily large
              numbers. To manage the complexity of the polyhedral

              interpretation is the creation of abstractions that
              yield analyses that are both tractable and precise
              enough to prove interesting properties about real-world
              programs. One source of difficulty is the need to handle
              programs with different behaviors along different
              execution paths. Disjunctive (powerset) abstractions
              capture such distinctions in a natural way. However, in
              general, powerset abstractions increase the space and
              time by an exponential factor. Thus, powerset
              abstractions are generally perceived as being very
              costly. In this paper we partially address this
              challenge by presenting and empirically evaluating a new
              heap abstraction. The new heap abstraction works by
              merging shape descriptors according to a partial
              isomorphism similarity criteria, resulting in a
              partially disjunctive abstraction. We implemented this
              abstraction in TVLA --- a generic system for
              implementing program analyses. We conducted an empirical
              evaluation of the new abstraction and compared it with
              the powerset heap abstraction. The experiments show that
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are as precise as the ones based on the fully
              disjunctive abstraction. In terms of performance,
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are often superior to analyses based on the fully
              disjunctive heap abstraction. The empirical results show
              considerable speedups, up to 2 orders of magnitude,
              enabling previously non-terminating analyses, such as
              verification of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite marking
              algorithm, to terminate with no negative effect on the
              overall precision. Indeed, experience indicates that the
              partially disjunctive shape abstraction improves
              performance across all TVLA analyses uniformly, and in
              many cases is essential for making precise shape
              analysis feasible."

              Termination inference generalizes termination analysis

              tries to prove that a given class of queries terminates.
              This class must be provided to the system, for instance
              by means of user annotations.  Moreover, the analysis
              must be redone every time the class of queries of
              interest is updated.  Termination inference, in
              contrast, requires neither user annotations nor
              recomputation.  In this approach, terminating classes
