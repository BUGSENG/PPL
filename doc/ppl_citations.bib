  Abstract = "Simulation relations can be used to verify refinement
              between a system and its specification, or between
              models of different complexity. It is known that for the
              verification of safety properties, simulation between
              hybrid systems can be defined based on their labeled
              transition system semantics. We show that for hybrid
              systems without shared variables, which therefore only
              interact at discrete events, this simulation preorder is
              compositional, and present assume-guarantee rules that
              help to counter the state explosion problem. Some
              experimental results for simulation checking of linear
              hybrid automata are provided using a prototype tool with
              exact arithmetic and unlimited digits."

              representation. If this representation is to gain
              acceptance, it is important to show that we may
              construct static analyses which operate directly on
              it. In this paper we present the first example of such
              an analysis, developed using the methodology of abstract
              interpretation.  The analysis is shown to be sound with
              respect to a concrete semantics for the representation.
              Experimental results are presented which indicate that
              the analysis performs well in comparison to conventional

  Abstract = "One of the continuing challenges in abstract
              interpretation is the creation of abstractions that
              yield analyses that are both tractable and precise
              enough to prove interesting properties about real-world
              programs. One source of difficulty is the need to handle
              programs with different behaviors along different
              execution paths. Disjunctive (powerset) abstractions
              capture such distinctions in a natural way. However, in
              general, powerset abstractions increase the space and
              time by an exponential factor. Thus, powerset
              abstractions are generally perceived as being very
              costly. In this paper we partially address this
              challenge by presenting and empirically evaluating a new
              heap abstraction. The new heap abstraction works by
              merging shape descriptors according to a partial
              isomorphism similarity criteria, resulting in a
              partially disjunctive abstraction. We implemented this
              abstraction in TVLA --- a generic system for
              implementing program analyses. We conducted an empirical
              evaluation of the new abstraction and compared it with
              the powerset heap abstraction. The experiments show that
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are as precise as the ones based on the fully
              disjunctive abstraction. In terms of performance,
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are often superior to analyses based on the fully
              disjunctive heap abstraction. The empirical results show
              considerable speedups, up to 2 orders of magnitude,
              enabling previously non-terminating analyses, such as
              verification of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite marking
              algorithm, to terminate with no negative effect on the
              overall precision. Indeed, experience indicates that the
              partially disjunctive shape abstraction improves
              performance across all TVLA analyses uniformly, and in
              many cases is essential for making precise shape
              analysis feasible."

              i.e., when groups of variables are unrelated with each
              other. Classical operations are adapted to work on such

              left-termination inference of logic programs.
              Termination inference generalizes termination analysis
              and checking.  Traditionally, a termination analyzer
              tries to prove that a given class of queries terminates.
              This class must be provided to the system, for instance
              by means of user annotations.  Moreover, the analysis
              must be redone every time the class of queries of
              interest is updated.  Termination inference, in
              contrast, requires neither user annotations nor
              recomputation.  In this approach, terminating classes
              for all predicates are inferred at once.  We describe
              the architecture of cTI and report an extensive
              experimental evaluation of the system covering many
              classical examples from the logic programming
              termination literature and several Prolog programs of
              respectable size and complexity."

              discovers linear invariant relationships among the

              establish important safety and liveness
              properties. Efficient techniques for the analysis of
              systems using polyhedra have been explored, leading to
              the development of successful tools like
              HyTech. However, existing techniques rely on the use of
              approximations such as widening and extrapolation in
              order to ensure termination. In an earlier paper, we
              demonstrated the use of Farkas' Lemma to provide a
              translation from the linear-relations analysis problem
              into a system of constraints on the unknown coefficients
              of a candidate invariant. However, since the constraints
              in question are non-linear, a naive application of the
              method does not scale. In this paper, we show that by
              some efficient simplifications and approximations to the
              quantifier elimination, not only does the method scale
              to higher dimensions, but also enjoys performance
              advantages for some larger examples."
