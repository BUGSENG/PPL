  Abstract = "A technique for generating invariant polynomial
              \emph{inequalities} of bounded degree is presented using
              the abstract interpretation framework.  It is based on
              overapproximating basic semi-algebraic sets, i.e., sets
              defined by conjunctions of polynomial inequalities, by
              means of convex polyhedra.  While improving on the
              existing methods for generating invariant polynomial
              \emph{equalities}, since polynomial inequalities are
              allowed in the guards of the transition system, the
              approach does not suffer from the prohibitive complexity
              of the methods based on quantifier-elimination.  The
              application of our implementation to benchmark programs
              shows that the method produces non-trivial invariants in
              reasonable time.  In some cases the generated invariants
              are essential to verify safety properties that cannot be
              proved with classical linear invariants."

              stack at each system call, has been used to achieve
              better characterization of program behavior. While there
              is common agreement that this additional information

              interpretation is the creation of abstractions that
              yield analyses that are both tractable and precise
              enough to prove interesting properties about real-world
              programs. One source of difficulty is the need to handle
              programs with different behaviors along different
              execution paths. Disjunctive (powerset) abstractions
              capture such distinctions in a natural way. However, in
              general, powerset abstractions increase the space and
              time by an exponential factor. Thus, powerset
              abstractions are generally perceived as being very
              costly. In this paper we partially address this
              challenge by presenting and empirically evaluating a new
              heap abstraction. The new heap abstraction works by
              merging shape descriptors according to a partial
              isomorphism similarity criteria, resulting in a
              partially disjunctive abstraction. We implemented this
              abstraction in TVLA --- a generic system for
              implementing program analyses. We conducted an empirical
              evaluation of the new abstraction and compared it with
              the powerset heap abstraction. The experiments show that
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are as precise as the ones based on the fully
              disjunctive abstraction. In terms of performance,
              analyses based on the partially disjunctive abstraction
              are often superior to analyses based on the fully
              disjunctive heap abstraction. The empirical results show
              considerable speedups, up to 2 orders of magnitude,
              enabling previously non-terminating analyses, such as
              verification of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite marking
              algorithm, to terminate with no negative effect on the
              overall precision. Indeed, experience indicates that the
              partially disjunctive shape abstraction improves
              performance across all TVLA analyses uniformly, and in
              many cases is essential for making precise shape
              analysis feasible."

              and checking.  Traditionally, a termination analyzer
              tries to prove that a given class of queries terminates.
              This class must be provided to the system, for instance
              by means of user annotations.  Moreover, the analysis
              must be redone every time the class of queries of
              interest is updated.  Termination inference, in
              contrast, requires neither user annotations nor
              recomputation.  In this approach, terminating classes
              for all predicates are inferred at once.  We describe
              the architecture of cTI and report an extensive
              experimental evaluation of the system covering many
              classical examples from the logic programming
              termination literature and several Prolog programs of
              respectable size and complexity."

  Abstract = "Linear-relations analysis of transition systems
              discovers linear invariant relationships among the
              variables of the system. These relationships help
              establish important safety and liveness
              properties. Efficient techniques for the analysis of
              systems using polyhedra have been explored, leading to
              the development of successful tools like
              HyTech. However, existing techniques rely on the use of
              approximations such as widening and extrapolation in
              order to ensure termination. In an earlier paper, we
              demonstrated the use of Farkas' Lemma to provide a
              translation from the linear-relations analysis problem
              into a system of constraints on the unknown coefficients
              of a candidate invariant. However, since the constraints
              in question are non-linear, a naive application of the
              method does not scale. In this paper, we show that by
              some efficient simplifications and approximations to the
              quantifier elimination, not only does the method scale
              to higher dimensions, but also enjoys performance
              advantages for some larger examples."

  Abstract = "We present a method for generating linear invariants for
              large systems. The method performs forward propagation
              in an abstract domain consisting of arbitrary polyhedra
              of a predefined fixed shape. The basic operations on the
              domain like abstraction, intersection, join and
              inclusion tests are all posed as linear optimization
              queries, which can be solved efficiently by existing LP
              solvers. The number and dimensionality of the LP queries
              are polynomial in the program dimensionality, size and
              the number of target invariants. The method generalizes
              similar analyses in the interval, octagon, and octahedra
              domains, without resorting to polyhedral
              manipulations. We demonstrate the performance of our
              method on some benchmark programs."

              modeled in the $\pi$-calculus by means of channel name
              passing. We chose SPIN because it supports channel name
              passing and can model reconfigurations. We extend the
              syntax of PROMELA and the verification algorithms based
              on the expected semantics. We demonstrate the
