#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AC_PROG_JAVAC
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AC_PROG_JAVAC tests an existing Java compiler. It uses the
#   environment variable JAVAC then tests in sequence various common
#   Java compilers. For political reasons, it starts with the free
#   ones.
#
#   If you want to force a specific compiler:
#
#   - at the configure.in level, set JAVAC=yourcompiler before calling
#   AC_PROG_JAVAC
#
#   - at the configure level, setenv JAVAC
#
#   You can use the JAVAC variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAVAC@.
#
#   *Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of
#   the CLASSPATH env. variable.
#
#   TODO: allow to exclude compilers (rationale: most Java programs
#   cannot compile with some compilers like guavac).
#
#   Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java
#   programs. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set,
#   some macros depend on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive
#   does not support the concept of set of macros, so I had to break it
#   for submission. The general documentation, as well as the sample
#   configure.in, is included in the AC_PROG_JAVA macro.
