#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AC_PROG_JAR
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AC_PROG_JAR tests for an existing jar program. It uses the
#   environment variable JAR then tests in sequence various common jar
#   programs.
#
#   If you want to force a specific compiler:
#
#   - at the configure.in level, set JAR=yourcompiler before calling
#   AC_PROG_JAR
#
#   - at the configure level, setenv JAR
#
#   You can use the JAR variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAR@.
#
#   Note: This macro depends on the autoconf M4 macros for Java
#   programs. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download that whole set,
#   some macros depend on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive
#   does not support the concept of set of macros, so I had to break it
#   for submission.
#
#   The general documentation of those macros, as well as the sample
#   configure.in, is included in the AC_PROG_JAVA macro.
